# Northridge TSA Website

This repository holds the source for a website created to compete in the
[TSA](http://tsaweb.org/) [Webmaster Competition](http://tsaweb.org/High-School-Competitions).
Utilizing popular web frameworks and tools, such as webpack, React, and Sass,
this repository contains it all.

To build/develop, there are a few npm scripts to help you:

* `npm start` starts the `webpack-dev-server`, hot reloading included!
* `npm run build` builds the application into the `dist/` directory.
* `npm run dev-production` builds the application in the production environment,
  but still runs the `webpack-dev-server`.
