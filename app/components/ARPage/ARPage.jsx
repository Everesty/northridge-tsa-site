      <h1>Augmented Reality</h1>
      <p>
        Augmented Reality is becoming a reality more and more. As it stands, AR
        is already integrating itself into more and more modern technology:
        games like Pokemon Go, utilities like Google Translate, and entertainment
        like Snapchat Filters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Future uses of AR include interactive chatting with friends, shopping
        where you can try on clothing/furnature in your own home, and even
        personal assistants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The benefits of Augmented Reality are clear just by its name:
        <i>Augmented Reality;</i> making reality better. As such, AR tends to
        increase the quality of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most AR technology can be shared with Virtual Reality. AR-specific
        technology, however, mostly comprises of Computer Vision and rendering.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the biggest concerns about AR technology is straight-up the
        security of AR technology; malicious breaches of security can lead to
        all kinds of problems, like &quot;perceiving&quot; an obejct that
        doesn&apos;t exist, or leaking sensor data (camera, microphone, etc.)
        to a remote host.
